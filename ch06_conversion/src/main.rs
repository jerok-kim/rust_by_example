/// # Conversion
/// 
/// Primitive types can be converted to each other through casting.
/// 
/// Rust addresses conversion between custom types (i.e., `struct` and `enum`) by the use of traits.
/// The generic conversions will use the `From` and `Into` traits.
/// However there are more specific ones for the more common cases,
/// in particular when converting to and from `String`s.
